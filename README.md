# Create meeting minutes from an Audio file

![meetingminutes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95a5bf75-7311-4c04-bf94-3cda0608e76c)


I downloaded some Denver City Council meeting minutes from this dataset:  
https://huggingface.co/datasets/huuuyeah/meetingbank

I've put them in my Google Drive. The goal of this product is to use the Audio to generate meeting minutes, including actions.

For this to work, you'll also need to download a clip from the Dever City Council, or for more fun, record something of your own!
